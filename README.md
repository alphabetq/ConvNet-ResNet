1. [`Label Generation.ipynb`](https://github.com/alphabetq/ConvNet-ResNet/blob/master/Label%20Generation.ipynb) Generate the labels by using a set of image data to feed in as input into a .CSV file.

2. [`pfnet.ipynb`](https://github.com/alphabetq/ConvNet-ResNet/blob/master/pfnet.ipynb) Train and test the model using VGG-ConvNet and use the trained model to identify the status of new sets of images.

3. (Optional) [`Resnet_DL.ipynb`](https://github.com/alphabetq/ConvNet-ResNet/blob/master/Resnet_DL.ipynb) Train and test the model using ResNet 18/34/50.
